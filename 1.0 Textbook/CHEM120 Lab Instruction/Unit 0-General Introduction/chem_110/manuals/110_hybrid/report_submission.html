<p>This guide is to help you to ensure that you submit your Lab Report correctly.</p>
<h2>How to Prepare Your Lab Report</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Word Lab Report Template provided to <strong>TYPE</strong> your answers.</li>
<li>Convert your Lab Report Template form into a .pdf document</li>
<li>Convert your signed Data Sheet and Personalized Procedure to the pdf format&nbsp;</li>
<li>Compile all the documents as a <strong>SINGLE</strong> .pdf file using a website such as <a href="https://www.ilovepdf.com/index.php">iLovePDF | Online PDF tools for PDF lovers</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For most programs, you can save your document as a pdf by clicking on <i>Save as </i>from the<i> File </i>menu and choosing *.pdf file extension from the dropdown menu.</p>

<div class="notice info">
<p>If you do not submit your Lab report as a .pdf file and your TA is unable to read the file, you will be assigned a "0" grade.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to Submit Your Lab Report File</h2>
<p>You can either submit your Lab Report directly under <i>Assignments</i> or going to <i>Content</i> then to your experiment tab and to the <i>Lab Report</i> tab for this experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Empty File</h2>
<p>A common mistake students make is to accidentally submit the empty template file for the lab report. Make sure that you save the file that you are working on under a different name before submitting it. You MUST verify on <i>MyCourses</i> what file you have submitted.</p>
<h2>Submitting the Wrong File</h2>
<p>It can be easy to upload the wrong file altogether, or to accidentally submit a file from a previous lab. Make sure that you always double check your submission to ensure that you have submitted the right file.</p>
<h2>No Submission</h2>
<p>If you accidentally don't press the <i>submit</i> button when submitting your files, we will not receive them and we won't be able to grade your lab report. Please ensure that you upload and submit the file.</p>

<div class="notice info">
<p>Once you have submitted a file, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to your <em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">@mail.mcgill.ca</span></em> e-mail address. If you do not receive an e-mail it means that you did not submit the file.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="check">Verifying your Submission on MyCourses</h2>
<p>In order to double check your submission on MyCourses you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <i>Assignments</i> in the top right corner of the <i>MyCourses page. <img src="../../../image_20240822140725140.png" width="448" height="60"></i></li>
<li>The page should now display all the assignments. In the column labelled <i>Completion Status</i> you can access all of your submissions. If you see <i>Not submitted</i> in this column, it either means you have not yet submitted your file or your submission was not successful.&nbsp;<img src="../../../PastedImage_5cf4724c9564480193ef9d104a6466b0_image.png" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></li>
<li>If your file was submitted successfully, you will see <span style="color: rgb(0, 135, 224);"># Submission, # File</span> in the <i>Completion Status&nbsp;</i>column. If you click on <span style="color: rgb(0, 135, 224);"># Submission, # File, </span>it will bring you to the files you have submitted. <img src="../../../image_20240822142517625.png" width="457" height="231"></li>
<li>You should then see all of the files you have submitted for the given lab and you can download and open the file to ensure that you have submitted a valid document. <img src="../../../PastedImage_fd94cea2005347be8526f963557e19d3_pic0.png" width="392" height="260"></li>
<li>If you have found you incorrectly submitted a file, you may resubmit a valid file. Only the last version of the document you submit will be graded and any late penalties applied will be based on the <em>MyCourses&nbsp;</em> timestamp of the last version that you submit.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notice warning">
<h2>Always Double Check</h2>
<p>Make sure to always double check all the above. If for any reason you do not properly submit your lab report or results, you will be given a grade of "0". You may be able to submit after the deadline with any relevant late penalties being applied to your submission. &nbsp;</p>
