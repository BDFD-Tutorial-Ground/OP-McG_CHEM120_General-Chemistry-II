<h2 id="manual">Lab Manuals</h2>
<p>The experimental manuals will be available on <i>MyCourses</i> at least one week before the experiment is scheduled to take place. On occasion, we will need to update the lab during the term. Should any changes be made to the lab manuals, we will post the new version on&nbsp;<i>MyCourses</i> and make an announcement if any major edits to the lab manual(s) have been made.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Instructional Methods</h2>
<p>You will perform the laboratory experiments either individually or in groups of 2-3 students, which will be specified in a lab manual for each experiment. The experiments should be completed within 2 hours.</p>
<p>Before coming to the laboratory, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the lab manual.</li>
<li>Complete the pre-lab quiz on MyCourses</li>
<li>Rewrite the lab procedure in a point form in your own words (typed, handwritten and in a diagram/schematic form is accepted) and print it. The electronic version will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Bring your personalized lab procedure with you. Your TA will check your procedure and sign it. The lab procedure is worth 2 points of your lab report grade.</li>
<li><b>You must submit an electronic copy of your procedure as a part of your lab report for each experiment on MyCourses after the lab.</b></li>
<li>Answer the extra questions at the end of the lab manual. These will not be graded but will help you prepare for the lab and the final lab quiz.</li>
<li>Print the Data Sheet provided in the manual and bring it to the lab, this is where you will record data and observations. You will only be able to see the datasheets once you receive ≥ 70% on the pre-lab quiz.</li>
<li>Once you have obtained ≥ 70% on your pre-lab quiz, the data sheet will become visible under the experiment tab.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>During the experiment</b></p>
<p>An assigned teaching assistant (TA) will supervise and assist you during each experiment. All the TAs report to the lab instructor.</p>
<p>Your TA is the first person you should turn to for questions or problems. If they are not available, seek the advice of another TA or the lab instructor. TAs will also be grading your lab reports based on the grading rubric provided by the lab instructor for each experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each lab, your TA will give a short pre-lab tutorial to provide complementary information and perform technical demonstrations.</li>
<li>The TA will check attendance and verify whether you have a hard copy of your personalized procedure and will sign it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notice warning">
<p><b>Important</b>: <i>If you do not have a hardcopy of your lab procedure at the beginning of the lab you will not be allowed to start your experiment.</i></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>When performing an experiment, you will record all data and observations directly onto the corresponding Data Sheet. Data sheets can be found under the experiment tabs. They are labelled with the heading&nbsp;<i>Data sheet</i>.</li>
<li>You will need your datasheet to complete your lab report.</li>
<li>All writing done in the lab must be in permanent ink (<i>no pencil</i>). Mistakes are to be corrected by drawing a single line through the error. Liquid paper and other techniques which make it impossible to read the original entry are not allowed.</li>
<li>You need to get your datasheet signed by your TA before leaving the lab.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>You will submit an electronic copy of your datasheet for each experiment to MyCourses after the lab as a part of your compiled lab report file</b>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notice warning">
<p>Experimental work should be completed 20 minutes before the end of the lab period to allow ample time for clean-up.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><b>After the experiment is completed</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean all the glassware and place it back to a bin.</li>
<li>Dispose of all the chemicals into a designated waste container</li>
<li>Before leaving, ask your TA to sign your data sheet. The data sheets that are not signed by a TA, will automatically receive “0” grade.</li>
<li>Compile your&nbsp; signed data sheet and personalized procedure together with the Lab Report form in one pdf file and submit to the MyCourses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>
<p>You will learn proper basic lab techniques such as using an electronic balance, spectrometer, different volumetric glassware such as volumetric flasks, graduated cylinders, pipettes, etc. Most of this equipment is expensive and fragile. We expect you to obey all safety rules, follow instructions, and be careful with instruments. Note the following basic rules concerning chemicals:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Chemicals needed for an experiment are usually placed on the perimeter benches or in the fume hoods. Do not monopolize reagents; take what you need (do not waste) and leave the containers where they are set.</li>
<li>Spills of chemicals must be cleaned at once (concentrated acids or alkali will need to be diluted with plenty of water, then wiped). If in doubt, ask a TA.</li>
<li>Dispose of chemicals as mentioned in the lab manual. Use the waste containers as indicated. When in doubt, ask a TA.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Safety">Safety</h2>
<div class="notice critical">
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Safety is of paramount importance in a chemistry lab. </span></strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>You must watch the safety video and complete a Safety Quiz on <i>MyCourses</i> in order for the course material to become available to you.</li>
<li>You must put your safety glasses and a lab coat before entering the lab and keep it on at all times including the pre-lab presentations.</li>
<li style="color: #ba4700; font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="color: #ba4700;">Students without lab coats, safety glasses, long pants or shoes will not be allowed to carry out experiments.</span></strong></li>
<li>The James McGill book store carries lab-coats and safety glasses.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ba4700;"><i>Contact lenses are forbidden in the laboratory.</i></span></strong> You must wear prescription glasses + safety glasses over top. Prescription glasses with side shields are not accepted.</li>
<li>Bags and coats must be stored in the proper spaces underneath your workbench to keep the circulation areas free.</li>
<li>Never leave your belongings unattended.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use cell phones or other electronic devices during the lab to avoid possible contamination unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>Gloves are always available near the lab prep room. We will highlight when gloves are mandatory in the lab manual, but you can always use gloves if you feel more comfortable wearing them.</li>
<li><b>Gloves protect you from direct contact with chemicals, which means chemicals stay on the gloves! You must avoid touching your face and your cell phone screen/computer keyboard with your gloves on to avoid surface contamination.</b></li>
<li>During the experiment, if you do not follow the safety procedures outlined in this document, in the safety video, and/or disobey instruction from the lab staff or your teaching assistant, you may be asked to leave the lab, and you will receive a grade of "0" for the experiment.</li>
<li><b>You may also receive up to a 10%-point penalty on your lab report if we have to remind you to put your safety glasses during the lab more then once.</b></li>
<li><b>All accidents must be reported, no matter how small.</b></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attendance">Lab Attendance</h2>
<p>Lab attendance is mandatory, and any missed labs must be made up for. You will be automatically given “0” for any lab you do not attend, and any lab report you do not submit as per Section 7.5 of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/policy_on_assessment_of_student_learning.pdf">McGill Student Assessment Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Your attendance will be taken during the lab. We take attendance by scanning your student ID card, so make sure that you bring it with you to every lab period. Your TA will also take your attendance on her/his attendance sheet.</p>
<p>A student who is more than 15 minutes late will not be allowed in and will be considered absent.</p>
<div class="notice warning">
<p><b>If you miss more than two labs without making it up, it will result in an automatic failure of the lab course component.</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
</div>
<p>There are six (6) labs in total and two (2) labs constitute 33% of the lab load. Missing 3 labs means that you miss 50% of all the labs and therefore can not achieve the following learning objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>apply and connect theory concepts to laboratory practice of chemistry</li>
<li>acquire basic chemistry laboratory technical skill such as using an electronic balance, preparing a solution of a given concentration, pipetting, preparing serial dilutions, etc.</li>
<li>properly use basic chemistry laboratory equipment such as and instruments such as glassware, balance, spectrometer, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to complete one of your scheduled labs for a legitimate reason (illness, quarantine restrictions, direct university conflicts), we may be able to schedule a makeup lab for you either during another session of that cycle, or during the makeup week at the end of the cycle.</p>
<p>Makeup labs must be arranged in advance. In case of a missed lab, contact the lab coordinator <a href="mailto:badawy.shaath@mcgill.ca?Subject=Chem%20110-120%20absense">Mr. Shaath</a> as soon as possible. Please include your lab day/time, group, course number, and student number in your email.</p>
<div class="notice warning">
<p>If you miss a lab for an approved reason and you provide an excuse note, you will be able to make up your lab without penalty.<strong> Otherwise, the following penalties will be applied to your lab report(s): 25% deduction for the first occurrence, 50% for the second, and 100% for the third. </strong>Please note that this rule also applies in situations where a student has come to perform their lab but has been sent home for an incomplete prelab or inappropriate lab attire.</p>
<p>Medical excuses will only be accepted with a doctor's note (the note must include the doctor's name, phone number, the date, and the reason for the absence).</p>
<p><u>If the first lab you miss is due to illness, you do not need to provide a medical note as long as you inform Mr. Shaath by email <i>before</i> your scheduled lab</u>; the 25% penalty will be waived in this case.</p>
<p><b>Please note that it is <u>not</u> possible to reschedule a lab due to a midterm scheduled the same day as your lab, unless there is a DIRECT time conflict.</b></p>
</div>
<p>We will make every effort to schedule makeups for missed labs; however, please note that due to the constraints of the lab space and schedule, in rare cases it may not be possible to reschedule. In some cases, you may instead be provided data so that you can complete a lab report for that experiment.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Lab Course evaluation</h2>
<p>For CHEM-120 students lab grade comprises 20% of the total CHEM-120 final grade.</p>
<p><strong>The laboratory is a required course component of CHEM 120. If you fail the lab and pass the lecture, you will receive an “F” grade and must redo the entire course.</strong></p>

<p><b><i>Work submitted for evaluation as part of this course may be checked with text-matching software within MyCourses.</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="quiz">Pre-Lab Quizzes</h2>
<p>Each lab will have an associated pre-lab quiz. The pre-lab quiz is designed to help you to properly prepare for your experiment. The pre-lab quiz is an open-book quiz, and it must be completed before coming to the lab. You will have to reach a minimum of 70% for the pre-lab quiz (3 attempts will be allowed and the highest score will be recorded) to be able to see the Data Sheet for a given experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Quiz Grade and Feedback</b>: The grade for each quiz will be shown after each attempt. All the questions and their answers will be released on MyCourses after the quiz period is over.&nbsp; Quizzes are graded for correctness. There are no partial marks for incorrectly answered questions on the quiz. Incorrect answers receive a grade of 0. If a quiz is not submitted/attempted before the due date/time, a grade of "0" for that quiz is automatically recorded.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="final">Final Quiz</h2>
<p>At the end of the term, you will perform a final lab quiz (20 points). The quiz will be available from<strong> April 7th at 8:00 am</strong> until <strong>April 8th at 11:59 pm</strong>. This quiz is designed to test the overall lab knowledge that you have acquired this term.</p>
<p>You will have 150 minutes to complete the final quiz. The timer will continue running even if you minimize or close the quiz.</p>
<p>We strive to help students who encounter barriers when writing the online quizzes. For this reason, each 90-minute quiz will have a 60-minute grace period for submission, giving you a total of 150 minutes to complete the 90-minute quiz. This grace period is available to all students.</p>

<h2 id="policy">McGill Policy Statements</h2>
<p><b><i>Policy Statement on Academic Integrity</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/code_of_student_conduct_and_disciplinary_procedures.pdf" rel="noopener">Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures</a>” (Approved by Senate on 29 January 2003) (See McGill’s guide to academic honesty for more information).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;L'université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l'on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/charte_des_droits_de_etudiant_0.pdf" rel="noopener">Code de conduite de l’étudiant et procédures disciplinaires</a>. » (Énoncé approuvé par le Sénat le 29 janvier 2003) (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le guide pour l’honnêteté académique de McGill.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Policy Statement on Language</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded. (Approved by Senate on 21 January 2009)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Conformément à la Charte des droits de l’étudiant de l’Université McGill, chaque étudiant a le droit de soumettre en français ou en anglais tout travail écrit devant être noté (sauf dans le cas des cours dont l’un des objets est la maîtrise d’une langue).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Policy Statement on Extraordinary circumstances</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the event of extraordinary circumstances, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Policy Statement on Course Material</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Instructor-generated course materials (e.g., handouts, notes, summaries, exam questions, etc.) are protected by law and may not be copied or distributed in any form or in any medium without explicit permission of the instructor.  Note that infringements of copyright can be subject to follow up by the University under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Policy Statement of Diverse Learners</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;As instructors of this course, we endeavor to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course, do not hesitate to discuss them with us and the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/">Student Accessibility and Achievement</a>, 514-398-6009. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Use of Generative AI</i></b><b> </b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence tools, to contribute to their understanding of course materials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are not encouraged, unless otherwise stated, to make use of artificial intelligence tools, including generative AI, to help produce assignments or reports. We believe that working through the assignments on your own will help you gain a better understanding of the course material and will better prepare you not only for the other course examinations, but also for the subsequent courses, internships, research opportunities, and jobs. However, students are ultimately accountable for the work they submit. Any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many organizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing information on citing generative AI (e.g., MLA: <a target="_blank" href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstyle.mla.org%2Fciting-generative-ai%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cpallavi.sirjoosingh%40mcgill.ca%7C022b70c65f6d4a0b50fb08dba8b7035d%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638289276202324350%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eQXw6N0lmXZbxOQCfi9aBfOK5WB1n8WjGOZ0kN6T1ME%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener">https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/</a> ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Student Assessment Policy</i></b></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/policy_on_assessment_of_student_learning.pdf">The University Student Assessment Policy</a> exists to ensure fair and equitable academic assessment for all students and to protect students from excessive workloads. All students and instructors are encouraged to review this Policy, which addresses multiple aspects and methods of student assessment, e.g. the timing of evaluation due dates and weighting of final examinations.”</p>
<p>"6.2. It is the responsibility of students to exercise due diligence in familiarizing themselves with the requirements and due dates for the assessment tasks for a course, as well as the circumstances that would permit academic accommodation."</p>
<p>"7.3. Students who wish to request an academic accommodation must do so before the assessment task is submitted."</p>
<p><b><i>Student Rights and Responsibilities</i></b></p>
<p>"Additional policies governing academic issues which affect students can be found in the McGill Charter of Students' Rights (see the&nbsp;<a title="Student Rights and Responsibilities" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/deanofstudents/students/student-rights-responsibilities">Student Rights and Responsibilities</a>)".</p>
