<h2>General Information and Instructions</h2>
<p>"Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogy that uses real-world problems to direct students towards the learning objectives of a course. Solving the problems requires that students build upon their background knowledge and gain new subject knowledge of the material that they have not yet studied. They gain this knowledge on a need to know basis in order to solve the problem." (<a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/pbl/pbl-defined-1">PBL Defined | Problem-Based Learning: Chemistry</a> )</p>
<p>The CHEM-120 PBL lab consists of two parts, <strong>PBL 1</strong> and <strong>PBL 2</strong>. Here is a general outline of the PBL process:</p>
<ol>
<li>During the <span style="color: #4500db;"><strong>Kinetics</strong></span> experiment,&nbsp;you will find a partner to work with and choose a problem to work on from the four problems provided (see the <strong>PBL 1 Problem List</strong> tab under "Content/Problem Based Learning")</li>
<li>You will then read additional information provided for your problem <span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>BEFORE</strong></span> coming to the PBL 1 lab (Feb 10-14, 2025 for <span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>BOTH</strong></span> groups <span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>A</strong></span> and <span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>B</strong></span>)</li>
<li>During the PBL 1 you will work with you partner under your TA's guidance to propose an experimental solution to the problem</li>
<li>After the PBL 1 lab, you will submit your proposal on MyCourses under the PBL 1 Assignment</li>
<li>Your TA will evaluate and approve your proposal as well suggest changes if needed</li>
<li>During the PBL 2 (Mar 24 - Apr 4, 2025) you will perform the experiment you proposed</li>
<li>After the PBL 2 lab you will write and submit your report on your experiment using the Lab Report Template provided for each problem</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 1: PBL 1 <span style="color: #ba4700; font-size: 20px;"><strong>(PLEASE BRING YOUR ELECTRONIC DEVICE)</strong></span><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong></strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>Before the lab:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose from one of the four problems provided to you</li>
<li>Perform a quick Internet search to start looking for possible solutions</li>
<li>Read the additional information provided for your experiment&nbsp;<span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>BEFORE</strong></span> coming to the lab</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>During the lab:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the lab, fill the table "<span style="color: #4500db;">What do we know/What we need to know</span>"</li>
<li>Search for the information you need to know.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your TA will guide you through the process and provide extra material/information if needed</li>
<li>Propose an experimental solution to your problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>Find a procedure</li>
<li>Write down the list of chemicals and apparatus you will need for your experiment</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>After the lab:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the report using the lab Report Template provided.</li>
<li style="color: #ba4700;"><span style="color: #ba4700;">YOU HAVE 7 DAYS TO SUBMIT YOUR REPORT</span></li>
<li style="color: #ba4700;"><span style="color: #ba4700;">EACH STUDENT SUBMITS AN INDIVIDUAL COPY OF THE REPORT</span></li>
<li style="color: #202122;"><span style="color: #202122;">The report should include</span>
<ul>

<h2><span style="color: #202122;">Part II: PBL 2</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #202122;">In the second part of the Problem Based Learning (PBL2) you will be performing experiments to test whether your proposed solution works.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #202122;">These are the steps you need to do.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>Before the lab:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the feedback your TA has provided for your PBL1 report</li>
<li>Modify your procedure accordingly (where applicable). Make sure you are working on a <span style="color: #e87511;"><strong>SMALL SCALE</strong></span></li>
<li>Obtain the necessary materials such as pencils, batteries, oil, etc. that you are planning to bring to the lab (where applicable)</li>
<li>Print the procedure you are going to use in the lab and bring it with you to the lab</li>
<li><span style="color: #cd2026;">Prepare your own Data Sheet template</span>. Make sure to include an observation section.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Print your personalized PBL2 Data Sheet and bring it with you to the lab</li>
</ul>
<div class="notice info">If you do not have your printed finalized procedure with you when you come to the lab, you will be asked to reschedule your lab and a penalty will apply.</div>
<h3><span style="color: #ba4700;"><strong>During the lab:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Show your printed final procedure to your TA and get it signed</li>
<li>Collect all the materials you need based on your procedure</li>
